### Work
**[Self Studio](https://www.selfstudio.se/)** (2021 – now)
I work as a part-time backend developer here. Used to develop an MVP for [LabClick](https://www.labclick.ru/). Now engaged in full-cycle development at [Teleporting](https://teleporting.com/) , mostly doing backend in **Nest.js**

**[Syg.ma](https://syg.ma)** (2018 – now)
Together with a team of friends we run this cultural organization. Central to this initiative is a multilingual media platform, powered by community of contributors and readers. Another big part of it is radio.syg.ma - independent label, music & broadcasting platform(we organize and held offline events aswell!). Also it has many subprojects which could be found [here](https://studio.syg.ma/). 
I did a migration from a old Rails (4) monolith to a new more flexible microservice-like architecture. Implemented an image optimization backend served through CDN, **Graphql**, **WebSockets**, Jobs as **Nest.js** services,  **CEO** & **database** optimization, **containerized infrastructure**, audio streaming (we have self-hosted solution), I did some [web-archiving](https://archive.syg.ma/) also. Managed to do several migrations of whole infrastructure "From cloud to another cloud". Responsible for all technical parts of the projects.

**[ORPK](https://orpk.org/)** (2020)
ORPK is a vast database housing hidden, rare, and significant books spanning centuries.
It has a **Rails** backend, a bit of **React** frontend and **Elastic** for search. To enhance discoverability and SEO, there's  image-to-text service, extracting valuable text from quotes, book pages, and giving it to search-engine robots.

**[Blizkie](https://blizkie.ru)** (2018 – 2020) 
Blizkie was a project providing a service for finding caregivers for people who needs in them or registering as a caregiver worker. It had a markeplace with chats, support, rating systems and etc, [separate app for workers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caregiversapp), CRM, Analytics. It had about 10k employees(caregivers) and about 20k/month orders a month.
I used to be a single developer there, so I was implementing **iOS** and **Android** apps, marketplace **Fronted**, **Rails** Backend for both apps, **database** management(we had our own implementation of Geocoding for e.x.), **staged infrustructure**, **CI**, **Server Administration**. Also I was fighting with stupid government firewall decisions and we were successfully bypassing them and I think I can't remember a lot more cases, in a nutshell, it was a startup in all its glory...

[**Doha Prize 2020**](https://web.archive.org/web/20211129230959/https://dalp.online/) (archived and closed now) 
This was a project for International Arabic Language Competition. 
I had around 40 docx documents which were storing the quizes information in Arabics ligature fromatted as hell. 4k question-answers pairs were successfully parsed, quiz-randomized system was implemented and competition had 10k+ participants as I remeber. Some code is available at [github](https://github.com/dddrey/DALP)

**Citadel** (June, 2018 – 2019) 
Citadel is a group of crypto-enthusiast people who are really into anonymity. They had a cold wallet for such coins as Monero, ZCash and FILF. I've been implementing a gateway integration with [BitShares](https://wallet.bitshares.org) blockchain platform, so people could exchange this coins with any other coins via tokens. Unfortunately this project is closed now, I could only find an archived [landing page](https://web.archive.org/web/20211126231157/https://citadel.li/) and my [PR](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/pull/1695/files)

**Some projects I've been making in a far, far past (~2016-2018)**
I want to mention them because these projects helped me to start my dev journey. From a frontend developer to growing as a FullStack expert.
